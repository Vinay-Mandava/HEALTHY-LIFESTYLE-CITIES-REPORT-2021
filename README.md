# HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CITIES REPORT 2021

## Abstract:
In the wake of the pandemic, a heightened focus on health and food hygiene has prompted a paradigm shift towards healthier lifestyles. Stress, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive gadget use have led to a generation characterized by perpetual fatigue. This project delves into the factors influencing happiness levels in cities, particularly those conducive to healthier living. Whether through increased physical activity, better dietary choices, or regular meditation, many are opting to relocate for a healthier lifestyle.

## Introduction:
This case study explores the intricate relationship between a city's happiness levels and various key factors. Geographic location profoundly influences aspects of life, from income potential to overall well-being. The criteria considered include sunshine hours, water bottle costs, obesity levels, life expectancy, pollution, happiness levels, outdoor activities, and the number of take-out places. Through data visualization and modeling, we aim to identify the primary factors influencing a city's happiness levels.

## Problem Statement:
This research paper unveils the rankings of cities based on their healthy lifestyles. Our team analyzed 44 global cities, evaluating their suitability for leading a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle across ten key metrics. From obesity levels to pollution rates, each city was meticulously scored. The primary objective is to predict the happiness level in a city based on various factors within the dataset. By employing suitable methods and selecting pertinent predictor variables, we aim to identify the optimal model that accurately describes happiness levels.

## Key Features:
